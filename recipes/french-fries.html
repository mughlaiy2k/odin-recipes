    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>French fries, also known as <em>pomme frites</em>, are a dish of deep-fried potato strips. They are typically cut into long, thin pieces and cooked until golden brown and crispy. 
        They are commonly served as a side dish or snack, often seasoned with salt and accompanied by ketchup, mayonnaise, or other sauces.</p>
